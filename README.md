First I downloaded the zip file “CS612JunitTestingLab” JAVA Eclipse project from the portal and unzipped that file
In eclipse, we opened the downloaded file and imported the project  into the local system
Created the java files for testing which includes AllTests.java, JunitTesting.java, testssquareofanumber.java, tocountAs.java, todividenumber.java with the code for the specific requirement
We Implemented the unit tests for the divide() method  for division of two numbers using todividenumber.java file 
created the tests for both positive and negative test cases and found the output as expected which includes square of a number for testssquareofanumber.java file
created the file tocountAs.java to count the number of times a alphabet is repeated in a specific word
when I find any errors, I debugged the code by going to that specific line and checking the code to correct the code and see where I made the errors
Modified the code accordingly and got the expected output
